<p><meta charset="utf-8">Through my majors in History and Greek &amp; Roman Studies and minors in Archaeology and Medieval &amp; Early Modern Studies, personally focusing mostly on the Central Mediterranean/North Africa and the effects of colonialism through archaeology, I’ve come to realize that historical research can serve as a valuable instrument in the fight for justice against colonialism and the way it continues to impact many communities globally. History and the various fields that relate to it, such as archaeology and museums, are powerful tools in engaging and collaborating with communities, and the (re)construction of identity, especially in post-colonial settings. What I’ve learned at Carleton through my programs, and through my involvement in clubs such as the History Undergraduate Society and Students for Justice in Palestine, has shaped my goals in fighting against colonialism and its legacy on Turtle Island, my ancestral homeland of Malta, and beyond.</p>
