<p><meta charset="utf-8">My classes have given me the tools to evaluate the societal and historical impacts of creativity and visual culture. Beyond the classroom, I’ve had Research Assistantships that&nbsp;have allowed me to explore the essential role that creativity has played in Canadian culture, particularly through a study of the history of radio design in the 20th century. My current role as the President of the Carleton Art History Undergraduate Society (CAHUS) has connected me to my peers through fun and creative events ranging from paint nights to portfolio reviews and an upcoming journal publication.</p>
