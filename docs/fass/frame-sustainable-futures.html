</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>
<p>In 2015, the United Nations outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the year 2030 as an urgent call to action to ensure environmental, economic and social prosperity for all and to protect our planet. </p>
</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>

<p>There are many ways to tackle the pressing challenge of addressing climate change and building <em>Sustainable Futures</em> by studying in  Carleton’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS). Health and wellness, education, food security, peace and justice, poverty reduction, and gender equality on local and global scales—these are all topics you can investigate through an array of FASS programs.</p>

<p>As the effects of climate change increasingly become our new lived reality, the world will need more graduates with the expertise to address these ecological shifts.</p>
</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>

</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>
<p>Several disciplines in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS) examine these profoundly complex environmental challenges from distinct vantage points.</p>
</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>

</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>
<p>Climate change policies are debated and shaped just down the road from Carleton on Parliament Hill, as several of the country's leading organizations tasked with caring for&nbsp;and&nbsp;conserving&nbsp;our environment are based out of Ottawa—many of which regularly&nbsp;collaborate with FASS professors and programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carleton students can work for federal government departments during their co-op and practicum placements, including Environment and Climate Change Canada and Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. </p>
</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>

<p>They can also gain hands-on experience with local government through the City of Ottawa, as well as through organizations like the Nature Conservancy of Canada and the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority.</p>
</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>

</div></div><div class="u-block u-block--white    "><div>
<p>In addition to the many experiential opportunities available, FASS students who choose to focus on <em>Sustainable Futures</em>&nbsp;get to engage with globally celebrated Carleton&nbsp;professors who research diverse topics that will critically shape our sustainable future —from permafrost and climate change in the western Arctic to precarity and equity in housing, planning, and urban governance issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">Throughout my degree, I have combined climate change-focused psychology courses with geography and earth science electives to gain a better understanding of anthropogenic climate change from both the human and planetary perspectives. In turn, my core psychology courses have offered me a solid background in human behaviour and cognition, which has helped me to understand the psychological barriers to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Finally, I have decided to focus my Honours Thesis on the topic of sustainability by examining&nbsp;the relationship between perceptions of self and nature and pro-environmental behaviours and attitudes. &nbsp;</p>
