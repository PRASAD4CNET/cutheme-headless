<p>Students who study <em>Mental Health and the Mind</em> in FASS at Carleton University, located in the heart of Ottawa, are afforded several fantastic opportunities unique to the nation's capital.<br><br>Ottawa is the place where federal health policies are conceived, shaped, and voted into existence. The city is also the headquarters for many mental health-focused NGOs and non-profit organizations that provide resources and support to communities across the country.  <br><br>As a result, Carleton students have access to a wealth of local and provincial organizations directly engaging with Canada’s biggest questions and challenges related to <em>Mental Health and the Mind</em>.</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8">Throughout my studies as a psychology student at Carleton, I’ve learned that one’s mental health and well-being are not simply influenced by their physiology, but through a complex, interdependent relationship between a variety of biological, psychological, and social factors. As the current President of Stigma Ends at CU, a student-led campaign dedicated to reducing the stigmatization of substance use and addiction within the Carleton University community, we recognize that stigma can have a significant impact on a person’s mental health and well-being, and can significantly impact accessibility to treatment. As such, I have begun to incorporate much of what I have learned from my courses and research into our campaign by adopting a bio-psycho-social approach in order to highlight the impact that stigma can have on each of these factors. In sharing this information, we hope that we can begin to reduce the stigma associated with substance use and addictions and improve the mental health and well-being of all Ravens!</p>

As the current President of Stigma Ends at CU, a student-led campaign dedicated to reducing the stigmatization of substance use and addiction within the Carleton University community, we recognize that stigma can have a significant impact on a person’s mental health and well-being, and can significantly impact accessibility to treatment. As such, I have begun to incorporate much of what I have learned from my courses and research into our campaign by adopting a bio-psycho-social approach in order to highlight the impact that stigma can have on each of these factors. In sharing this information, we hope that we can begin to reduce the stigma associated with substance use and addictions and improve the mental health and well-being of all Ravens!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"has-text-align-left\"\u003eExamples of Mental Health and the Mind Coursework\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://carleton.ca/first-year-seminars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eFirst Year Seminars\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://carleton.ca/first-year-seminars/fysm-1508/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFYSM\u0026nbsp;1508\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003eStress, Coping and Well-being\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do you cope with stress?
