As the current President of Stigma Ends at CU, a student-led campaign dedicated to reducing the stigmatization of substance use and addiction within the Carleton University community, we recognize that stigma can have a significant impact on a person’s mental health and well-being, and can significantly impact accessibility to treatment. As such, I have begun to incorporate much of what I have learned from my courses and research into our campaign by adopting a bio-psycho-social approach in order to highlight the impact that stigma can have on each of these factors. In sharing this information, we hope that we can begin to reduce the stigma associated with substance use and addictions and improve the mental health and well-being of all Ravens!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left\">Examples of Mental Health and the Mind Coursework</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://carleton.ca/first-year-seminars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">First Year Seminars</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://carleton.ca/first-year-seminars/fysm-1508/\" target=\"_blank\">FYSM&nbsp;1508</a>&nbsp;<br>Stress, Coping and Well-being</strong><br>How do you cope with stress?
